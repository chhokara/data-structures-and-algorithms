// Binary Seach Time Complexity
// Worst Case - O(log n)
// Average Case - O(log n)
// Best Case - O(1) (middle element is the one we want)

// The number of steps it takes to search a value in an array of
// n elements is O(log n) where n is the number of elements.
// Every time we double the number of elements, the number of steps to
// search for a value increases by one.
