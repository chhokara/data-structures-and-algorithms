// ============ STEP 1: UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM ============

// ================================================================
// write a function, that when given two numbers, returns their sum
// ================================================================

// 1. Can I restate the problem in my own words?
// "implement addition"

// 2. What are the inputs that go into the problem
// - ints?
// - floats?
// - what about strings for large numbers?

// 3. What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem
// - int? float? string?

// 4. can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem?

// 5. How should I label the important pieces of data that are part of the problem?
