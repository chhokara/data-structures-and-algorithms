// ============ STEP 3: BREAK IT DOWN =====================

// Explicitly write out the steps you need to take

// Write a function charCount() that takes in a string and returns counts for each character in the string

function charCount(str) {
  // create an object that will contain the counts for each character
  // loop over each character in the string
    // if the character is a number/letter AND is a key in the object, increment its value by 1
    // if the character is a number/letter AND is not in the object, add it to object and set its value to 1
    // if the character is not a number or letter (space, period, etc.), don't do anything
  // return the object containing the counts
}
